# Safety-App
 This system is for Traveler's safety and overcomes existing systems. This GPS system is the “Traveler's Safety App”. It consists of a GPS device, an Android phone. The unit will provide status information such as latitude, the longitude of the user. 

The proposed App is based on advanced sensors. Each time a user makes a phone call, an emergency signal will be generated automatically and then an information alert will be sent to the contacts that have been added to the emergency call.  

In the new application, we provide a user-friendly connection where the user can send notification information in a simpler and more intelligent way. The user did not need to forget all the important contact numbers for their siblings or friends. The new system is also interactive for users and gives them the opportunity to get to know the police, the hospital, and their location.
